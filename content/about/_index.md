Hey ! I'm Roman, currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html" target="_blank">ALMAnaCH team at Inria Paris</a>, a research team focused on Natural Language Processing. 

Before that, I was a student at ENS Paris-Saclay's MVA master degree, and an engineering student at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech. I also interned at <a href="https://europe.naverlabs.com" target="_blank">Naver Labs Europe</a>. You can find <a href="/pdf/Resume_Castagne.pdf" target="_blank">my resume here</a>.

### My work
Currently, my main interest lies around improving existing multilingual Language Models. In particular, I study how the **tokenization process impacts the performance** on low resource languages, and how to mitigate this negative effect.

I am also interested in studying the **time dynamics of a language model** : 
- Can we speed up model training, or improve training when less data is available ?
- How does the model evolve after training ? Can we make sure a model stays relevant in an ever evolving world ?
