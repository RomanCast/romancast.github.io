Here are some of the projects I have been working on recently. You can find my full resume <a href="/pdf/Resume_Castagne.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03844262/document" target="_blank">MANTa</a> *Findings EMNLP (to appear)* *2022*
: MANTa is a differentiable tokenization module which learns to segment input sequences end-to-end with the Language Model objective.

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100" target="_blank">BLOOM</a> *2022*
: BLOOM is a Large Language Model resulting from a collaborative, open source effort. I actively participated in creating its tokenizer.

<a href="https://camembert-model.fr/posts/tutorial/" target="_blank">Hands-on CamemBERT</a> *June 2022*
: We gave a 3 hours-long tutorial on how to use and finetune CamemBERT, a French Language Model and turned it into a blogpost (in French).

<a href="/pdf/RL_ALFD_project.pdf" target="_blank">Active Learning from Demonstrations</a> *MVA RL course* *2021*
: We designed an agent robust to imperfect demonstrations and evaluated it in discrete and continuous environments.

<a href="/pdf/RecVis_SinGAN_project.pdf" target="_blank">SinGAN for Inpainting</a> *MVA Computer Vision course* *2021* 
: We adapt SinGAN for inpainting using Partial Convolutions.

<a href="/pdf/DL_project.pdf" target="_blank">Domain Shift in Disaster Tweets Classification</a> *MVA Deep Learning course* *2021*
: We study the impact of domain shifts on Disaster Tweet Classifiers, and solutions to mitigate potential degradations.
