<a href="https://camembert-model.fr/posts/tutorial/" target="_blank">Hands-on CamemBERT</a> *June 2022*
: We gave a 3 hours-long tutorial on how to use and finetune CamemBERT, a French Language Model and turned it into a blogpost (in French).

<a href="/pdf/RL_ALFD_project.pdf" target="_blank">Active Learning from Demonstrations</a> *MVA RL course* *2021*
: We designed an agent robust to imperfect demonstrations and evaluated it in discrete and continuous environments.

<a href="/pdf/RecVis_SinGAN_project.pdf" target="_blank">SinGAN for Inpainting</a> *MVA Computer Vision course* *2021* 
: We adapt SinGAN for inpainting using Partial Convolutions.
